OBJECT OF THE GAME

THE PLAY
Players either draw the top card of the stock deck or take the top card of the discard pile and add it to their hand. The player may also lay down on the table, any meld (matched set). If the player does not wish to lay down a meld, they discard one card onto the discard pile.

LAYING OFF
A player may add one or more cards from their hand to any matched set already shown on the table.

GOING OUT
When a player gets rid of all of their cards, they win the round.
Hand points are totaled based on the cards remaining in a player's hand.
The hand-total(if any) of the player that ended the round is subtracted from the opponent's hand-total.
The round ending player is then awarded the difference.
When a player reaches 100 points they win the game.

KNOCKING
If a player's deadwood cards(cards that cannot be melded) total value is 10 or less they may choose to end the round by knocking.
Knocking will end the round, allowing the opponents to layoff any possible meld cards before hands are totaled.


GAMEPLAY:
Each player is dealt 10 cards, they must draw from the deck or the discard pile.
The player can then form melds based on the cards in their hand or based on current melds if any in the respected play area.
A player uses the numeric index below the hand output to select cards that can be played alone or in sets/runs. Play continues until a player plays all of their cards carefully making sure they can always discard one card, signaling the end of their turn. Points are awarded according to the rummy rules above.
